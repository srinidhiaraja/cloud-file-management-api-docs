# cloud-file-management-api-docs
**Fictional API documentation for a cloud-based file management system**

This is a dummy project designed to simulate the documentation process for a cloud-based file management system. While the API endpoints and documentation provided here are not connected to any real system, they demonstrate my understanding of API documentation tool Swagger and my ability to create comprehensive documentation for cloud-based services.
